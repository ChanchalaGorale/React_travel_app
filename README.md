# React_travel_app
react web app

In this app I have use below npm packages:
* npx create-react-app travelapp
* npm install react-router-dom

I have also used icons from https://fontawesome.com/ to get the app logo and social media icons.

You can experince reusing react componets and applications responsiveness here.
